# bash.org-ipfs

Somebody suggested in freenode/#ipfs that bash.org should be archived for posterity, so here we go.

The spider depends on scrapy (this has been developed with 1.4.0).

Run it like this: `scrapy runspider spider.py` and you should find your export in `bash.org/`.

You can also find an export from 2017-08-19 here: <https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZgQLZxd3MEHe2zDnm4whgmHcyF1YSB5VYx4vLPf8BaZs>
